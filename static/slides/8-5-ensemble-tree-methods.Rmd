## Bagging

- Instead of using one big tree, .hlight[bagging] constructs $B$ classification and regression trees using $B$ bootstrapped datasets.

--

- Each tree is grown deep and has high variance, but low bias. 

--

- Averaging all $B$ trees reduces the variance. 

--

- Improve accuracy by combining hundreds or even thousands of trees.

--

- To predict,
  + a continuous outcome, drop new $X$ down each tree until getting to terminal leaf. Predicted value of $Y$ is the average of all $B$ predictions across all the trees.
--

  + a categorical outcome, select the most commonly occurring majority level among the $B$ predictions.


---
## Random forests

- The trees in bagging would be correlated since they are all based on the same data (sort of!).

--

- .hlight[Random forests] attemps to de-correlate the trees.

--

- Random forests also constructs $B$ classification and regression trees using $B$ bootstrapped datasets but only uses a sample of the predictors for each tree.

--

- Doing so prevents the same variables from dominating the splitting process across all trees.

--

- Both bagging and random forests will not overfit for large $B$.


---
## Random forests

- .hlight[Random forest algorithm]:

--
  
  For $b = 1, \ldots, B$,
  1. Take a bootstrap sample of the original data. 
      + Alternatively, can take a sub-sample of the original data of size $m < n$, where $n$ is the sample size of the collected data.
  
--

  2. Take a sample of $q < p$ predictors, where $p$ is the total number of predictors in the dataset.
  
--

  3. Using only the data in the bootstrapped sample or sub-sample, grow a tree using only the $q$ sampled predictors. Save the tree.
  
--

- For predictions, do the same thing as in bagging.

--

- Variable importance measures based on how often a variable is used in splits of the trees.


---
## Random forests vs. parametric regression: benefits

- No parametric assumptions.

--

- Automatic model selection.

--

- Multi-collinearity not problematic.

--

- Can handle big data files, since trees are small.

--

- In R, use the `randomForest` package.


---
## Random forests vs. parametric regression: limitations

- Regression prediction limitations like those for CART.

--

- Hard to assess chance error.

--

- Little control over the few parameters to tweak if model does not fit the data well.



---
## Boosting

- .hlight[Boosting] works like bagging, except that the trees are grown sequentially.

--

- Specifically, each tree is grown using information from previously grown trees.

--

- After the first tree, the remaining trees are built using residuals as outcomes.

--

- The idea is so that boosting can slowly improve the model in areas where it does not perform well.

--

- Boosting does not involve bootstrap since each tree is fit on a modified version of the original data set.

--

- It can overfit if the number of trees is too large.

--

- There are so many boosting methods! This is just one of them.



---
## Boosting

- Goal: to construct a function $\hat{f}(y|x)$ to estimate true $f(y|x)$.

--

- .hlight[Boosting algorithm]:

--

  1. Fit a decision tree $\hat{f}$ with $d$ splits to the data using $Y$ as the outcome. Compute the residuals.
  
--

  2. For $b = 2, \ldots, B$,
      + Fit a decision tree $\hat{f}^b$ with $d$ splits to the data using the residuals as the outcome.
      + Add this new decision tree into the fitted function: $\hat{f} = \hat{f} + \lambda \hat{f}^b$.
      + Compute updated residuals.

--
  3. Output the boosted model: $\hat{f} = \sum_{b=1}^B \lambda \hat{f}^b$.
  
--

- The shrinkage parameter $\lambda$ (often small, e.g. 0.01) controls the rate at which boosting learns.



---
## General advice about tree methods vs parametric regressions

- When the goal is prediction and sample sizes are large, tree methods can be effective engines for prediction.

--

- When the goal is interpretation of predictors, or when sample sizes are modest, use parametric models with careful model diagnostics.

--

- Either way, always remember the data:
  + What population, if any, are they representative of?
  + Are the definitions of variables what you wanted?
  + Are there missing values or data errors to correct?


---
## Arsenic example again

- Recall the study measuring the concentrations of arsenic in wells in Bangladesh.

--

- We already fit a logistic regression to the data.

--

- We will use the same data to compare these models.

--

- Research question: predicting why people switch from unsafe wells to safe wells.

--

- The data is in the file `arsenic.csv` on Sakai.



---
## Arsenic example again


Variable    | Description
:------------- | :------------
Switch | 1 = if respondent switched to a safe well <br /> 0 = if still using own unsafe well
Arsenic | amount of arsenic in well at respondent's home (100s of micro-grams per liter)
Dist | distance in meters to the nearest known safe well
Assoc | 1 = if any members of household are active in community organizations <br /> 0 = otherwise
Educ | years of schooling of the head of household

- Treat switch as the response variable and others as predictors.
