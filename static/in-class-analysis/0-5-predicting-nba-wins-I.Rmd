## Structure and format
You will work in your pre-assigned teams. Each team should submit ONLY ONE report for this exercise. You must write the names of all team members at the top of the report containing your responses. You all must do the work using one student's computer and R/RStudio. 

Have one team member open R/RStudio on their computer and share their screen with the other team members within the breakout room. At the top of the team report, write **"host"** in parenthesis besides this student's name. Have another team member be responsible for documenting the responses. At the top of the team report, write **"writer"** in parenthesis besides this student's name. 

**NOTE**: Generally, you will not be penalized for not taking on these roles many times during the semester. This is to simply ensure that you do switch the roles around a "decent number" of times within each team throughout the semester. That said, I will penalize any student who obviously dominates these roles over everyone else, so be sure to give other students an opportunity to do them.

## R/RStudio
You all should have R and RStudio installed on your computers by now. If you do not, first install the latest version of R here: https://cran.rstudio.com (remember to select the right installer for your operating system). Next, install the latest version of RStudio here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Scroll down to the "Installers for Supported Platforms" section and find the right installer for your operating system.


## Gradescope
Gradescope will let you select your team mates when submitting, so make sure to do so. Only one person needs to submit the sheet on Gradescope. You can submit your document in the most common formats, but **pdf** files are preferred. Submit on Gradescope here: https://www.gradescope.com/courses/280392/assignments. Be sure to submit under the right assignment entry.



# Introduction
The purpose of this exercise is to give you additional practice working with logistic regression. The exercise is based on the NBA Team Game Stats dataset found here:  https://www.kaggle.com/ionaskel/nba-games-stats-from-2014-to-2018/. Read more about the problem and dataset under the description section of the link.

Kaggle is a great online community of data scientists. To learn more about Kaggle, follow this link: https://www.kaggle.com/getting-started/44916.

<font color="brown">**For this exercise, you will need to select ONLY ONE NBA team in the data. Also, you will need to set aside data for the 2017/2018 season as test data. Write the name of the team you selected at the top of your report**</font>


# The data
Download the data (named `nba_games_stats.csv`) from Sakai and save it locally to the same directory as your R markdown file. To find the data file on Sakai, go to Resources $\rightarrow$ Datasets $\rightarrow$ In-Class Analyses. Once you have downloaded the data file into the SAME folder as your R markdown file, load and clean the data by using the following R code.

```{marginfigure}
Again, you are expected to select ONLY ONE NBA team in the data. Also, set aside data for the 2017/2018 season as test data.
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
nba <- read.csv("nba_games_stats.csv",header = TRUE,sep = ",",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Set factor variables
nba$Home <- factor(nba$Home)
nba$Team <- factor(nba$Team)
nba$WINorLOSS <- factor(nba$WINorLOSS)

# Convert date to the right format
nba$Date <- as.Date(nba$Date, "%Y-%m-%d")

# Also create a binary variable from WINorLOSS. 
# This is not always necessary but can be useful 
#particularly for R functions that prefer numeric binary variables
#to the original factor variables
nba$Win <- rep(0,nrow(nba))
nba$Win[nba$WINorLOSS=="W"] <- 1

# I picked the Charlotte Hornets (CHO) as an example,
#you should pick any team you want
nba_reduced <- nba[nba$Team == "CHO", ]

# Set aside the 2017/2018 season as your test data
nba_reduced_train <- nba_reduced[nba_reduced$Date < "2017-10-01",]
nba_reduced_test <- nba_reduced[nba_reduced$Date >= "2017-10-01",]
```

You will only use the `nba_reduced_train` data today, but will use the `nba_reduced_test` data in the next in-class exercise.

# Exercises

Treat the variable <font color="green">Win</font> (or <font color="green">WinorLoss</font>) as your response variable and the other variables as potential predictors. Answer all questions using only the <font color="green">nba_reduced_train</font> data. Leave the `nba_reduced_test</font> data for next time.

1. Make exploratory plots to explore the relationships between <font color="green">Win</font> and the following variables: <font color="green">Home</font>, <font color="green">TeamPoints</font>, <font color="green">FieldGoals.</font>, <font color="green">Assists</font>, <font color="green">Steals</font>, <font color="green">Blocks</font> and <font color="green">Turnovers</font>. Don't include any of the plots, just briefly describe the relationships.

2. Just by looking at the code book, there are several combinations of variables we should not include as predictors in the logistic model. Identify at least two pairs and explain in at most two sentences, why we should not include them in the model at the same time.

3. Fit a logistic regression model for <font color="green">Win</font> (or <font color="green">WinorLoss</font>) using <font color="green">Home</font>, <font color="green">TeamPoints</font>, <font color="green">FieldGoals.</font>, <font color="green">Assists</font>, <font color="green">Steals</font>, <font color="green">Blocks</font> and <font color="green">Turnovers</font>. as your predictors. Using the <font color="green">vif</font> function, are there are any concerns regarding multicollinearity in this model?

4. Present the output of the fitted model and interpret the significant coefficients in terms of the odds of your team winning an NBA game.

5. Using 0.5 as your cutoff for predicting wins or losses (1 vs 0) from the predicted probabilities, what is the accuracy of this model? Plot the roc curve for the fitted model. What is the AUC value?

<!-- 6. Now add `Opp.FieldGoals.` as a predictor to the previous model. Is the coefficient significant? If yes, interpret the coefficient in the context of the question. -->

<!-- 7. What is the accuracy of this new model? Plot the roc curve for the fitted model. What is the new AUC value? Which model predicts the odds of winning better? -->

<!-- 8. Using the results of the model with the better predictive ability, what suggestions do you have for the coach of your team trying to improve the odds of his team winning a regular season game? -->

<!-- 8. Use this model to predict out-of-sample probabilities for the `nba_reduced_test` data. Using 0.5 as your cutoff for predicting wins or losses (1 vs 0) from the out-of-sample predicted probabilities, what is the out-of-sample accuracy? How well does your model do in predicting data for the 2017/2018 season? -->

<!-- 10. Using the change in deviance test, test whether including `Opp.Assists` and `Opp.Blocks` in the model at the same time would improve the model. Is there any other variable in this dataset which we did not consider that you think might improve our model? Which one and why? -->
