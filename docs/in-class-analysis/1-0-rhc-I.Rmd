## Structure and format
You will work in your pre-assigned teams. Each team should submit ONLY ONE report for this exercise. You must write the names of all team members at the top of the report containing your responses. You all must do the work using one student's computer and R/RStudio. 

Have one team member open R/RStudio on their computer and share their screen with the other team members within the breakout room. At the top of the team report, write **"host"** in parenthesis besides this student's name. Have another team member be responsible for documenting the responses. At the top of the team report, write **"writer"** in parenthesis besides this student's name. 

**NOTE**: Generally, you will not be penalized for not taking on these roles many times during the semester. This is to simply ensure that you do switch the roles around a "decent number" of times within each team throughout the semester. That said, I will penalize any student who obviously dominates these roles over everyone else, so be sure to give other students an opportunity to do them.

## R/RStudio
You all should have R and RStudio installed on your computers by now. If you do not, first install the latest version of R here: https://cran.rstudio.com (remember to select the right installer for your operating system). Next, install the latest version of RStudio here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Scroll down to the "Installers for Supported Platforms" section and find the right installer for your operating system.


## Gradescope
Gradescope will let you select your team mates when submitting, so make sure to do so. Only one person needs to submit the sheet on Gradescope. You can submit your document in the most common formats, but **pdf** files are preferred. Submit on Gradescope here: https://www.gradescope.com/courses/280392/assignments. Be sure to submit under the right assignment entry.



# Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to help you gain some experience doing causal inference.

```{r fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.width=4}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rhc.JPG")
```

Right Heart Catheterization (RHC) is a procedure for directly measuring how well the heart is pumping blood to the lungs. The procedure involves an insertion of a catheter (hollow tube) into right side of heart and through to pulmonary artery to monitor heart function and blood flow from the heart to lungs. RHC is often applied to critically ill patients for directing immediate and subsequent treatment. However, administering RHC may cause serious complications, though the risks are usually small. There is some debate whether the use of RHC actually leads to improved treatment.


# The Data

Download the data file (named `rhc.txt`) from Sakai and save it locally to the same directory as your R markdown file. To find the data file on Sakai, go to Resources $\rightarrow$ Datasets $\rightarrow$ In-Class Analyses. Once you have downloaded the data file into the SAME folder as your R markdown file, load and clean the data by using the following R code.

```{marginfigure}
Remember to double-check the dimensions and first few rows of the data to confirm you have the right file. Also, convert the two variables `treatment` and `dth30` to binary variables. You MUST exclude the variable `surv2md1` from the analysis, as shown in the code, so that you are left with 51 covariates.
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Load libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(cobalt)
library(MatchIt)
library(randomForest)

# Read in the data
RHC <- read.table("rhc.txt",header=T,stringsAsFactors = T)
RHC <- RHC[,-which(names(RHC)=="surv2md1")]
RHC[,sapply(RHC,is.logical)] <- 
  lapply(RHC[,sapply(RHC,is.logical)], as.factor)
#RHC$treatment <- as.numeric(RHC$treatment) - 1 #optional
RHC$dth30 <- as.numeric(RHC$dth30) - 1
```

The dataset contains data on 5735 hospitalized adult patients at five medical centers in the U.S. The variable `treatment` indicates whether RHC was applied within 24 hours of admission (TRUE/FALSE). Each patient was followed up with some treatment procedures that may have been influenced by the RHC result if it was performed on the patient. 

**The outcome variable is `dth30` -- death at 30 days (TRUE: dead; FALSE: alive). Note that after loading in the data, we have now converted this variable to binary, so that, 1 = dead and 0 = alive**

Based on information from a panel of experts, a set of 52 variables were identified that are potentially related to both the decision to use RHC and the outcome. The goal is to estimate the treatment effect of RHC on death at 30 days. Let *pr(Y(w) = 1) = p<sub>w</sub>* be the fraction of patients with `dth30=1` for treatment group *w* (*w=0* or *1*, that is `rhc/treatment=FALSE` or `rhc/treatment=TRUE` respectively). 

**The target estimand is the average causal effect *Q = p<sub>1</sub> - p<sub>0</sub>* for patients with `treatment=TRUE`.**

That is, we will focus on estimating ATT and not ATE, that is, treatment effect for those who actually received RHC. Clearly, this analysis models death, which means high probabilities are BAD. If RHC works, ATT should be negative.

# Exercises

1. Based only on the information available to you, can you consider this a randomized study? Why or why not?

2. Are the covariates in this data balanced between the two groups (`rhc/treatment=FALSE` vs `rhc/treatment=TRUE`)? If no, which covariates are not? How did you assess balance?

3. Fit a regression model to the response variable `dth30` using the main effects of ALL covariates and `rhc/treatment`. Using the fitted model, compute the ATT for the patients with `rhc/treatment=TRUE` as follows:
      + <font color="blue">(a)</font> Generate predicted probabilities for patients with `rhc/treatment=TRUE` using the fitted model. This is an estimate of  *p<sub>1</sub>* for those patients.  
      *<font color="red">In `R`, you can use `predict(model_object,type="response")`.</font>*
      + <font color="blue">(b)</font> For the same patients, set `rhc/treatment=FALSE` and their values for the other covariates unchanged, and generate new predicted probabilities for them. This is an estimate of  *p<sub>0</sub>* for those patients.
      + <font color="blue">(c)</font> Compute the individual treatment effects by taking the difference *p<sub>1</sub> - p<sub>0</sub>* for each patient and average across all treated patients (patients whose original value of `rhc/treatment` equals `TRUE`). The average is the estimated ATT.
      
4. 
```{marginfigure}
You really should be answering this question using a confidence interval, so as to quantify uncertainty. We will not do this in class but it can be done relatively easily via `bootstrap`. You will learn bootstrap soon and should then try this on your own.
```
Based on your estimated effect from question 2, are treated patients better or worse off with RHC?

5. Given your answer to question 2, do you trust your conclusions from question 4?  Why or why not?  

<!-- # ```{marginfigure} -->
<!-- # You can implement the bootstrap procedure by embedding the first two steps in a `for` loop. -->
<!-- # ``` -->
<!-- # Use bootstrap to construct a confidence interval for the estimated ATT in question 2 as follows: -->
<!-- #       + For $b = 1, \ldots, B$, -->
<!-- #         - Re-sample the rows of the original sample with replacement (you can use the `sample` function in R and set the option `replace=TRUE`). -->
<!-- #         - Use your code in steps (a) to (c) in question 2 to estimate the  *ATT<sup>b</sup>* for bootstrap sample $b$. -->
<!-- #        -->
<!-- #     ```{marginfigure} -->
<!-- # You can use the `quantile` function in R here. To find 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of a vector `x`, use `quantile(x, probs = c(0.025,0.975))`. -->
<!-- # ``` -->
<!-- #       + Compute the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of  *ATT<sup>1</sup>,...,ATT<sup>B</sup>*. That is the estimated 95% bootstrap confidence interval. -->
<!-- #   Interpret the interval.  -->
      
<!-- 4. Estimate the propensity score *e* using a logistic regression with all covariates entering in the model as main effects. Assess overlap: that is, are there any observations with an estimated propensity score *e* that is out of the range of *e* in the other group? If there are only a few such outliers (less than 5), keep them; If many, discard them and report the number of the discarded observations. -->

<!-- 5. Using one-to-one, nearest neighbor matching on the estimated propensity scores, check balance again. Are the covariates balanced now? If no, which ones are not? -->

<!-- 6. -->
<!-- ```{marginfigure} -->
<!-- Use a normal approximation to construct the 95% confidence interval, where the standard error should be estimated using the formula for computing standard error for difference in proportions (if you are not familiar with this, check page 280 of the [OIS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-DHaDEbiOGkc1RycUtIcUtIelE/view) book we used for the online summer review). -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Estimate the average causal effect $Q$ using the matched sample obtained above. Construct a 95% confidence interval and interpret your findings. Are treated patients better or worse off with RHC?   -->
<!--   *<font color="red">Note that the estimated average causal effect computed on the matched sample is the ATT we want (where the treated group is `rhc = 1`) and not ATE, because we will discard observations in the control group for which we cannot find matches for. This is something you should keep in mind should you want to estimate ATE on your own projects and applications in the future.</font>* -->

<!-- 7. Now estimate the propensity score *e* using Random forests with all the covariates. Assess overlap: that is, are there any observations with an estimated propensity score *e* that is out of the range of *e* in the other group? If there are only a few such outliers (less than 5), keep them; If many, discard them and report the number of the discarded observations. -->

<!-- 8. Using one-to-one, nearest neighbor matching on the new estimated propensity scores from question 7, check balance again. Are the covariates balanced now? If no, which ones are not? -->

<!-- 9. Estimate the average causal effect $Q$ using the new matched sample obtained in question 8. Construct a 95% confidence interval and interpret your findings (use your code from question 6). -->

<!-- 10.  -->
<!-- ```{marginfigure} -->
<!-- Note that this estimated effect is no longer an estimate of *Q = p<sub>1</sub> - p<sub>0</sub>* but intuitively, we can still draw "roughly" the same conclusions from it. -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Using the new matched sample obtained in question 8, fit a logistic regression to the response variable using the main effects of all covariates. Also include the new propensity scores *e* from question 7 as a predictor. Report the estimated causal odds ratio and its corresponding confidence interval. Interpret your findings. Are your overall findings in line with your findings from question 9? -->
