## Springbok analysis

The data contains counts of springbok antelope around 25 watering holes.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="400px",out.width="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/springbok2.jpg")
```

The data is in the file `springbok.csv` on Sakai.

## Springbok analysis

- Springbok are counted at each site (hole) at an altitude of 200-300 meters.

--

- A survey normally includes counts at all 25 sites but occasionally some sites could not be counted because of poor weather.

--

- For larger groups of springbok, color photographs were taken and springbok were counted later from the photos. 

--

- Several surveys, usually 7-10, were made each year. 

--

- Within a year, springbok are faithful to a single site. That is, if a springbok goes to site $i$ on one day, it will return to site $i$ on other days.

--

- We want to
  + Analyze trend
  + Estimate the effects of predictors

## Springbok analysis data

- n = 1050 counts from 1990-2002 for sites 12-21, 23, and 24. 

-  The other sites were excluded because they usually don't have many antelope. 

- Three time variables: year, date (week) and hour from noon.

Variable    | Description
:------------- | :------------
LOCNUMBER | Location Number 
SITEI | Site
YEAR | Year (1990 - 2002) 
DATE | Week (14 - 42)
HourFromNoon | Hour From Noon (Numeric)
COUNTS | Springbok Count (Discrete)
