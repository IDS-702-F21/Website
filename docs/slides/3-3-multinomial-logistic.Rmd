## Recall logistic regression

- Recall that for logistic regression, we had 
.block[
.small[
$$
y_i | x_i \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(\pi_i); \ \ \ \textrm{log}\left(\dfrac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i
$$
]
]

  for each observation $i = 1, \ldots, n$.

--
 
- To get $\pi_i$, we solved the logit equation above to get
.block[
.small[
$$\pi_i = \dfrac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}}$$
]
]

--

- Consider $Y=0$ a baseline category. Suppose $\Pr[y_i = 1 | x_i] = \pi_{i1}$ and $\Pr[y_i = 0 | x_i] = \pi_{i0}$. Then, the logit expression is essentially
.block[
.small[
$$\textrm{log}\left(\dfrac{\pi_{i1}}{\pi_{i0}}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$$
]
]

--

- $e^{\beta_1}$ is thus the (multiplicative) change in odds of $y = 1$ over the baseline $y = 0$ when increasing $x$ by one unit.



---
## Multinomial logistic regression

- Suppose we have a nominal-scale response variable $Y$ with $J$ categories. First, for the .hlight[random component], we need a distribution to describe $Y$.

--

- A standard option for this is the .hlight[multinomial distribution], which is essentially a generalization of the binomial distribution.  
  Read about the multinomial distribution [here](https://www.olanrewajuakande.com/STA111-Summer2018-Course-Website/Lectures/Lecture6.pdf) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution).

--

- .hlight[Multinomial distribution] gives us a way to characterize
.block[
.small[
$$\Pr[y_i = 1] = \pi_1, \ Pr[y_i = 2] = \pi_2, \ \ldots, \ \Pr[y_i = J] = \pi_J, \ \ \ \textrm{where} \ \ \ \sum^J_{j=1} \pi_j = 1.$$
]
]

--

- When there are no predictors, the best guess for each $\pi_j$ is the sample proportion of cases with $y_i = j$, that is,
.block[
.small[
$$\hat{\pi}_j = \dfrac{\mathbf{1}[y_i = j]}{n}$$
]
]

--
 
- When we have predictors, then we want
.block[
.small[
$$\Pr[y_i = 1 | \boldsymbol{x}_i] = \pi_{i1}, \ \Pr[y_i = 2 | \boldsymbol{x}_i] = \pi_{i2}, \ \ldots, \ \Pr[y_i = J | \boldsymbol{x}_i] = \pi_{iJ}.$$
]
]



---
## Multinomial logistic regression

- That is, we want the $\pi_j$'s to be functions of the predictors, like in logistic regression.

--

- Turns out we can use the same .hlight[link function], that is the logit function, if we set one of the levels as the baseline.

--

- Pick a baseline outcome level, say $Y=1$.

--

- Then, the multinomial logistic regression is defined as a set of logistic regression models for each probability $\pi_j$, compared to the baseline, where $j\geq 2$. That is,
.block[
.small[
$$\textrm{log}\left(\dfrac{\pi_{ij}}{\pi_{i1}}\right) = \beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j} x_{i1} + \beta_{2j} x_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_{pj} x_{ip},$$
]
]

  where $j\geq 2$.

--
  
- We therefore have $J-1$ .hlight[separate logistic regressions] in this setup.



---
## Multinomial logistic regression

- The equation for each $\pi_{ij}$ is given by
.block[
.small[
$$\pi_{ij} = \dfrac{e^{\beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j} x_{i1} + \beta_{2j} x_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_{pj} x_{ip}}}{1 + \sum^J_{j=2} e^{\beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j} x_{i1} + \beta_{2j} x_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_{pj} x_{ip}}} \ \ \ \textrm{for} \ \ \ j > 1$$
]
]

  and
.block[
.small[
$$\pi_{i1} = 1-\sum^J_{j=2} \pi_{ij}$$
]
]

--

- Also, we can extract the log odds for comparing other pairs of the response categories $j$ and $j^\star$, since
.block[
.small[
$$
\begin{split}
\textrm{log}\left(\dfrac{\pi_{ij}}{\pi_{ij^\star}}\right) & = \textrm{log}\left(\pi_{ij}\right) - \textrm{log}\left(\pi_{ij^\star}\right) \\
 & = \textrm{log}\left(\pi_{ij}\right) - \textrm{log}\left(\pi_{i1}\right) - \textrm{log}\left(\pi_{ij^\star}\right) + \textrm{log}\left(\pi_{i1}\right) \\
& = \left[ \textrm{log}\left(\pi_{ij}\right) - \textrm{log}\left(\pi_{i1}\right) \right] - \left[ \textrm{log}\left(\pi_{ij^\star}\right) - \textrm{log}\left(\pi_{i1}\right) \right] \\
& = \textrm{log}\left(\dfrac{\pi_{ij}}{\pi_{i1}}\right) - \textrm{log}\left(\dfrac{\pi_{ij^\star}}{\pi_{i1}}\right).
\end{split}
$$
]
]

## Multinomial logistic regression

- Each coefficient has to be interpreted relative to the baseline.

--

- That is, for a continuous predictor,
  + $\beta_{1j}$ is the .hlight[increase (or decrease) in the log-odds] of $Y=j$ versus $Y=1$ when increasing $x_1$ by one unit.
  + $e^{\beta_{1j}}$ is the .hlight[multiplicative increase (or decrease) in the odds] of $Y=j$ versus $Y=1$ when increasing $x_1$ by one unit.

--
 
- Whereas, for a binary predictor,
  + $\beta_{1j}$ is the .hlight[log-odds] of $Y=j$ versus $Y=1$ for the group with $x_1 = 1$, compared to the group with $x_1 = 0$.
  + $e^{\beta_{1j}}$ is the .hlight[odds] of $Y=j$ versus $Y=1$ for the group with $x_1 = 1$, compared to the group with $x_1 = 0$.

--
 
- Exponentiate confidence intervals from log-odds scale to get on the odds scale.



---
## Significance tests

- For multinomial logistic regression, use the change in deviance test to compare models and test significance, just like we had for logistic regression.

--

- Fit model with and without some predictor $x_k$.

--

- Perform a change in deviance test to compare the two models.

--

- Interpret p-value as evidence about whether the coefficients excluded from the smaller model are equal to zero.



---
## Model diagnostics

- Use binned residuals like in logistic regression.

--

- Each outcome level has its own raw residual. For each outcome level $j$,

--

  + make an indicator variable equal to one whenever $Y = j$ and equal to zero otherwise
  
--

  + compute the predicted probability that $Y=j$ for each record (using the `fitted` command)

--

  + compute the raw residual = indicator value - predicted probability

--

- For each outcome level, make bins of predictor values and plot average value of predictor versus the average raw residual. Look for patterns.

--

- We can still compute .hlight[accuracy] just like we did for the logistic regression.

--

- ROC on the other hand is not so straightforward; we can draw a different ROC curve for each level of the response variable. We can also draw pairwise ROC curves.



---
## Implementation in R

- Install the package .hlight[nnet] from CRAN.

- Load the library: `library(nnet)`.

- The command for running the multinomial logistic regression in R looks like:
  ```{r eval=F}
Modelfit <- multinom (response ~ x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_p, data = Data)
```
  
- Use `fitted(Modelfit)` to get predicted probabilities for observed cases.

--

- We will see an example in the next module.
